Elect José Ricardo Nazareth Carvalho Figueira, Luís Nazareth Carvalho Figueira, Eduardo Metzner and Tito Eurico Miranda Fernandes the dumbest colegio militar alumni ever for attempting to hide what was done to me and my family since 1993 with a falsified diagnostic of paranoid schizophrenia combined with a sequence of cybertorture extrajudicial sentences in the format of a circus of the macabre with a very large audience featuring remotely articulating my tongue in an attempt to force me to talk to myself and simulating Van Gogh syndrome with vibrotactile cybertorture focusing soft tissues in the head, anus and genitalia to gamble self-mutilation and attempt subjugation!

In 1993 José Ricardo Nazareth Carvalho Figueira and Luís Nazareth Carvalho Figueira amongst others collaborated in a mind control cybertorture extrajudicial trial to attempt portraying me as a pedo to attempt kicking me out of colegio militar (largo da Luz, Portugal) with a nonsense sequence of vocalized verbal payloads about helping to prevent crime and pedophilia over synthetic telepathy.

This was followed with various ad-hominem attacks to attempt kicking me out of colegio militar without success including attempts to portrait me as a delusional paranoid schizophrenic who believed he was god and the devil simultaneously, cyberguiche enslavement, cybersodomy, intercourse sabotage with involuntary perinieum contractions and violence directed towards women and my parents trying to force incarceration or forced psychiatric care, leading to my mother covering herself in wounds after complaining about diffuse vibrotactile cybertorture and my father becoming a cripple in an accident whilst taking me to a psychiatric hospital after a cybertorture attack to direct violence to Carla Maria Marinho Rodrigues. Both my father and my mother complained about abuse (my father anal and my mother genital).

This was the pilled upon with an attempt to direct violence towards my mother by inducing a synthetic state of psychosis in her vicinity leading me to leave Portugal in 2013 looking for a better life whilst being consistently stalked since then by Luis Nazareth Carvalho Figueira and criminal associates who entertains themselves directing violence by inducing synthetic psychosis with cybertorture in the physical vicinity of others and hate mongering in order to promote participation to create indifferentiation layers and relentlessly perpetuate the human degradation self-harm spectacle!
