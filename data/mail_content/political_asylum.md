Dear Sir / Madam,

My name is Claudio André Silva Nunes Marques Neto
(Portuguese ID 11229457),

I am SARS-COV-2 free and I write to request political asylum under extreme duress via extrajudicial cybertorture at the hands of Colégio Militar former students trying to hide an attempt to orchestrate a pedophilia accusation to kick me out of school at age 14 and trying to force me to mutilate my genitalia for refusing to leave!

This was pilled upon with criminal association with elected government officials and law enforcement to portrait me as schizophrenic, torture me genitally and create a spectacle of the macabre consisting of: attempting to make me lose my job, turn me violent against my patents and women along with sabotaging sex and resorting to cybersodomy and forced role reversal to attempt turning me into a sexually frustrated drug addict 24 hours a day since at least 2016!

As such I seek “freedom from want” and “freedom from fear” away from this repugnant treatment me and my family endure and away from the claws of fascism!

Here follows some of my cybertorture and psychiatric abuse story

My sincere appologies!
