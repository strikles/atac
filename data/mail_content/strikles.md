## [Four Freedoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Freedoms)

The Four Freedoms were goals articulated by United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt on Monday, January 6, 1941. In an address known as the [Four Freedoms speech](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Four_Freedoms_speech) (technically the 1941 State of the Union address), he proposed four fundamental freedoms that people "everywhere in the world" ought to enjoy:

0. [Freedom of speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech)
0. [Freedom of worship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_worship)
0. [Freedom from want](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_from_want)
0. [Freedom from fear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_from_fear)

> Roosevelt delivered his speech 11 months before the surprise Japanese attack on U.S. forces in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii that caused the United States to declare war on Japan, December 8, 1941. The State of the Union speech before Congress was largely about the national security of the United States and the threat to other democracies from world war that was being waged across the continents in the eastern hemisphere. In the speech, he made a break with the long-held tradition of United States non-interventionism. He outlined the U.S. role in helping allies already engaged in warfare.

> In that context, he summarized the values of democracy behind the bipartisan consensus on international involvement that existed at the time. A famous quote from the speech prefaces those values: "As men do not live by bread alone, they do not fight by armaments alone." In the second half of the speech, he lists the benefits of democracy, which include economic opportunity, employment, social security, and the promise of "adequate health care".

> The United Nations Honour Flag (also termed the United Nations Flag, the Honour Flag, or the Four Freedoms Flag, with alternate spelling "Honor" also used) was a flag symbolizing the Allies of World War II and their goal of world peace. It was designed in October 1942 by Brooks Harding (who was inspired by Franklin D. Roosevelt's Four Freedoms speech of January 1941), and it had some degree of use as a flag from 13 June 1943 to c. 1948 to represent the "United Nations" in the sense of the January 1942 Declaration by United Nations. However, it was never an official flag of the United Nations as an organization (which was founded in 1945, and adopted a different flag of the United Nations in 1946).

## [Jos√© Saramago, Religious Offence and Freedom of Speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_offense)
Nobel Prize winner [**Jos√© Saramago**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Saramago) went into exile as a symbolic gesture on the Spanish island of Lanzarote in 1992 when the Government of Portugal under Prime Minister [An√≠bal Cavaco Silva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An%C3%ADbal_Cavaco_Silva) ordered the removal of one of his works [**The Ghospel according to Jesus Christ**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gospel_According_to_Jesus_Christ) from the Aristeion Prize's shortlist, claiming the work was religiously offensive.

Some of these individuals **insinuated** via synthetic telepathy Jos√© Saramago exiled himself due to [**cybertorture**](https://www.undocs.org/A/HRC/43/49).
They also **insinuated** they asked him what was the worst book he ever read to which he allegedly replied [**The Rape of the Mind**](https://www.amazon.com/Rape-Mind-Psychology-Menticide-Brainwashing/dp/1614277877) by [Joost Meerloo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joost_Meerloo) who coined the term [**menticide**](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/menticide).

This was followed by his work [**Blindness**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindness_(novel)) which they claimed was a social critique to the mass participation in the process and refusal to address the issue due to lack of a [**Neurolaw**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurolaw) framework, which has recently found [real use cases](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01762/full).
In 2004 Jos√© Saramago published his novel [**Seeing**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seeing_(novel)).

## Cybertorture as a [ùÑû *Opera Cepa* ùÑ¢](https://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2409430)
Most humans are [reward seeking agents](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3004012/) driven by selfish self-interest, often resulting in [coup agents playing a deception game](https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/downloadFile/1126295043834443/Thesis%20-%20Filipe%20Fortes.pdf) and consequently [criminal behavior](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07362994.2019.1636658?journalCode=lsaa20) which could be nearly eradicated in a [Transparent Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Transparent_Society). Social Behavior and [Cooperative Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_game_theory) may involve altruistic agents who in opposition to selfish agents put the interests of others above their own...

[Game Theory and Cooperation: How Putting Others First Can Help Everyone](https://kids.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/frym.2017.00066)
> Leo Durocher, a famous baseball player from the 1930s, once said that ‚ÄúNice guys finish last.‚Äù That may be true in baseball, but it is not true in life more generally. In this article, we use ideas from the branch of mathematics known as ‚Äúgame theory‚Äù to study a situation known as the ‚ÄúPrisoners‚Äô Dilemma (PD),‚Äù which sheds light on why people often fail to work well together. Game theory shows that people who are kind and trustworthy have a strategic advantage, as they can ‚Äúchange the game‚Äù to escape the PD and make everyone better off, including themselves. So, truly, ‚Äúnice guys finish first.‚Äù

For decades the United Nations have tried to raise awareness to address issues that affect our society whilst being mostly ignored by governments worldwide.
With the advent of [A/HRC/43/49 recognizing Cybertorture](https://www.undocs.org/A/HRC/43/49), combined with progress in the fields of Neuroscience and Neurolaw and raised interest in [neuromodulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromodulation_(medicine)) as a therapeutic procedure, along with the public disclosure of scientific content such as [neuromodulation of attention](pdf/1-s2.0-S0896627318300114-main.pdf) mechanisms, an opportunity has been created for someone to turn [arrows into flowers](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/60546298.pdf) by allowing individuals to [regulate their own states of mind](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3579548/) via self-rewarding payloads in a quasi-continuous closed feedback loop, using the same medium used for cybertorture and hence eradicating narcotraffic!

Lack of a Neurolaw framework and lack of a law enforcement entity dedicated to enforce Neurolaw and preserve Neurorights and Mental Freedom (particularly at home and at work) gives rise to social stratification by resorting to cybertorture to distort [self-determination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-determination) and corrupt data of threat assessment systems like [MOSAIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOSAIC_threat_assessment_systems), corrupting crucial data used by well intentioned institutions like the World Health Organization!

This obviously results in paranoid behavior regarding [Global Surveillance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_surveillance), [Right to Privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_privacy), [Physician Patient Privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician%E2%80%93patient_privilege), [Secret Ballot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_ballot), [Intimacy and Privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy#Intimacy), [Right to be let alone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy#Right_to_be_let_alone), and results in lack of trust in:

0. Law enforcement
0. The Judicial System
0. Elected Government Officials
0. Psychiatrists
0. The Electoral Process
0. One another :(

Why would I bother spending money on public transport to vote when my every intention can be scrutinized as a victim of cybertorture ?
Since voting is compulsory, suffrage over synthetic telepathy would solve the problem of lack of participation in the electoral process. All that is required is trust :)

Most of these issues would not exist if we followed the [Open Source Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_model) or at the very least, the rules were made Clear and Transparent. Obscurity and deception games culminate in [Solitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitude), delusional quests for [Anonymity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymity), [Aggression and Violent Behavior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression_and_Violent_Behavior) and acts of [Terrorism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism). Please bear in mind [Guy Fawkes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Fawkes) was a terrorist (hence an idiot) and so was [Robert Catesby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Catesby) ring leader of the failed [Gunpowder Plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunpowder_Plot)!

[Mi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solf%C3%A8ge) is a beautiful musical note but unless if you are composing something like [4'33''](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4%E2%80%B233%E2%80%B3) **WE** need more musical notes to create a [ùÑû melody ùÑ¢](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80D3vkuLaxs).

Whilst I am an adept of [Transparent Behavior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)), I also like "fair game" and I highly value my [personal autonomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomy) which should not be put in jeopardy by being forced into unemployment and welfare via cybertorture extrajudicial sentences so that I can't support myself and my "laptop" and "mobile phone" being set as targets to be destroyed under states of extreme exhaustion via sleep deprivation by sadists out of control who draw pleasure from generating synthetic psychotic behavior.

The notes of this [ùÑû *Operetta di Cipolla* ùÑ¢](https://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2409430) are the following:

0. Stealing adventure books in full uniform when I was 10 years old!
0. The dual standards of stealing exams and finals and engaging in "criminal like" behavior, as if the school was a training camp for the special operations group ([a standard during my time as a student in Col√©gio Militar and an issue which I believe has recently been addressed](http://www.asjp.pt/2016/04/09/tradicoes-militares-colidem-com-o-poder-politico/))!
0. Conspiring to turn me into a synthetic psychopath labelled as "white trash", trying to direct violence towards my parents and women, trying to turn me into a drug addict and trying to get me to mimic the xenophobic, homophobic and misogynistic behaviour of others like [**Gon√ßalo Bandeira Duarte**](https://pt.linkedin.com/in/gon%C3%A7alo-duarte-b71078107?trk=people-guest_people_search-card) (and his criminal associates recruited for the effect) as if I was a parrot!
0. Using me and my family as involuntary clowns in a circus of extrajudicial trials and sentences whilst acting in the utmost arrogance trying to hide under the cover of criminal association with prominent members of society to give me a pointless moral lesson, relying both on lack of legislation and someone to enforce it!

The following [collaborationists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborationism) and their criminal associates participated in different ways in delivering tortuous payloads repeatedly trying to generate self-harm human degradation content for the extrajudicial circus. Some gave their full heart to the cause, others tried to exact their sentences in a suave and effortless fashion, and others attempted to maximize impact attempting to be as poisonous as they could, resorting to controlling my tongue with phrases combining corruption of words like "Police", "Portugal", "Catholic" and "Netherlands" revealing their true psychotic nature ;)

#### [My cybertorture story >>>](MentisMorbumTuum.md)

## Cybertorture as [Extrajudicial punishment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrajudicial_punishment)

Cybertorture is a means to exact [extrajudicial punishment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrajudicial_punishment) for those who **allegedly** evade loopholes in the legal system and as a form of [social stratification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stratification). It may involve acting in criminal association with others who are recruited (and possibly manipulated), either to make the case untriable, or as a form of entrapment.

People are willing to act as social justiciary riders for multiple reasons. The most common is probably to exact justice for behavior they may find offensive such as: xenophobia, homophobia, pedophilia, misogyny, stalking, sexual abuse, animal abuse, issuing threats or being agressive towards people in their social circle (sexual partners, children, co-workers and prominent members of society).

Some are made to believe in concepts such as social stratification, synthetic winners and synthetic losers and "naturally" wish to rise on the social ladder. Others are plain psychopaths, sexual predators, sodomites or sadists out of control addicted to degrading others and want to perpetuate their status quo, unwilling to repent or address their mental illness!

The methodology may involve:

0. forcing synthetic pain upon the SUT ([remote activation/deactivation of nociceptors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nociceptor))
0. forcing vibrotactile sensations upon the SUT ([remote activation/deactivation of mechanoreceptors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanoreceptor))
0. misregulating normal physiological functionality ([GPC Receptors and signaling pathways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_protein-coupled_receptor))
0. forcing [synthetic telepathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain%E2%80%93computer_interface#Synthetic_telepathy/silent_communication) upon the SUT

It creates more problems than it solves resulting in:

0. financial loss for insurance companies
0. abuse of psychiatry and medical malpractice [**en masse**](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2589690)
0. wasted human and financial resources in redundant or [**flawed scientific research**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causes_of_schizophrenia#Candidate_gene_studies) by working with sets of corrupted data consisting of [**real illness**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Origin_of_the_%22Influencing_Machine%22_in_Schizophrenia) and victims of [**cybertorture**](https://www.undocs.org/A/HRC/43/49)
0. abuse of threat assessment systems like [**MOSAIC**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOSAIC_threat_assessment_systems)
0. further loss of moral values by setting the wrong example resulting in behavior contagion

![](img/bigglesworth.png)

Grotesque examples:

0. getting the SUT to commit acts of [self-mutilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-harm) (including genital) or [self-harm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-harm)
0. [forcing sodomy as a sentence](https://www.britannica.com/place/Sodom-and-Gomorrah#ref1233950) upon the SUT
0. articulating tongue and jaw movements of the SUT
0. directing violence towards others (parents, sexual partners, shop keepers, neighbors, police officers, psychiatrists, etc)
0. forcing the SUT to extract teeth
0. instructing the SUT to pick scabs from wounds
0. forcing the SUT to scratch himself via synthetic itches
0. [Sexual abuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_abuse) of the SUT possibly resulting in [Stockholm Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome)
0. forcing the SUT to feel synthetic pain in the anus, ears and lower back
0. forcing the SUT to feel stabbed in the skull
0. forcing the SUT to feel stabbed in the back
0. forcing sleep deprivation and extreme exhaustion upon the SUT
0. delivering thermoelastic payloads to soft tissues in the head of the SUT to draw self-harm
0. delivering thermoelastic payloads to the cerebellum and occipital area of skull the SUT to draw self-harm
0. delivering thermoelastic payloads to the base of the skull of the SUT to dislodge it
0. targeting electronic equipment that may be used to work or use social media (computer, laptop and mobile phone)
0. forcing the SUT to feel kicks all over the body and head to feel like human trash
0. forcing the SUT to roam the streets aimlessly to spend all his money by combining all of the above
0. nurturing [addictive behaviour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction) by combining all of the above
0. Intensifying this methodology when in close proximity to others, prior to scheduled events or festive occasions such as birthdays, Christmas and New Years Eve

## [Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders)

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) is the 2013 update to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the taxonomic and diagnostic tool published by the American Psychiatric Association (APA). In the United States, the DSM serves as the principal authority for psychiatric diagnoses. Treatment recommendations, as well as payment by health care providers, are often determined by DSM classifications, so the appearance of a new version has practical importance. The DSM-5 is the first DSM to use an Arabic numeral instead of a Roman numeral in its title, as well as the first "living document" version of a DSM.

The DSM-5 is not a major revision of the DSM-IV-TR but there are significant differences. Changes in the DSM-5 include the reconceptualization of Asperger syndrome from a distinct disorder to an autism spectrum disorder; the elimination of subtypes of schizophrenia; the deletion of the "bereavement exclusion" for depressive disorders; the renaming of gender identity disorder to gender dysphoria; the inclusion of binge eating disorder as a discrete eating disorder; the renaming and reconceptualization of paraphilias, now called paraphilic disorders; the removal of the five-axis system; and the splitting of disorders not otherwise specified into other specified disorders and unspecified disorders.

Some authorities criticized the fifth edition both before and after it was published. Critics assert, for example, that many DSM-5 revisions or additions lack empirical support; inter-rater reliability is low for many disorders; several sections contain poorly written, confusing, or contradictory information; and the psychiatric drug industry may have unduly influenced the manual's content ([many DSM-5 workgroup participants had ties to pharmaceutical companies](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc0810237))

## [Cybertorture and Psychiatric Abuse](#mentis-morbum-tuum-)

In Portugal an article under the title ["Mental illness is inevitable"](https://expresso.pt/sociedade/2017-06-13-Diogo-Telles-Correia-A-doenca-mental-e-inevitavel) was published by [Jornal Expresso](https://expresso.pt)

> It's like watching a conversation: on the ‚ÄúThink. To feel. Living ‚Äù, we read Judite Sousa's questions and received the answers from [Diogo Telles Correia](https://www.amazon.com.br/Livros-Diogo-Telles-Correia), psychiatrist, psychotherapist and professor at the Faculty of Medicine of Lisbon. The result is a book that paints an accessible picture of what is the ‚Äúinevitable‚Äù mental illness in the 21st century, the time of the hurried man, with no time to reflect; the child's time clinging to television or school books, hyperactive and unstoppable; the time of depression and anxiety, harassment at work and potentially psychopathic politicians. To Expresso, the specialist clarifies by email if the current world is making us (more) sick and tells us which professions are most affected by a world in which it seems prohibited to stop.

**Whilst I do agree with the statement that "the current world is making us (more) sick" due to evidence of [cybertorture](https://www.undocs.org/A/HRC/43/49) and psychiatric abuse worldwide being denounced by the United Nations, I stronly disagree with notions of ‚Äúinevitable mental illness" and forced conventional pharmacotherapy paired with cybertorture, cybersodomy, vibrotactile torture (includimng genital) to simulate [Van Gogh Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Gogh_syndrome).**

#### [Psychiatry and the dark side: eugenics, Nazi and Soviet psychiatry Published online by Cambridge University Press](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/advances-in-psychiatric-treatment/article/psychiatry-and-the-dark-side-eugenics-nazi-and-soviet-psychiatry/5A5950F52D74D0B5FC5418642C5211D1)
02 January 2018, Jason Luty

> Psychiatrist Thomas Szasz fought coercion (compulsory detention) and denied that mental illness existed. Although he was regarded as a maverick, his ideas are much more plausible when one discovers that between 1939 and 1941, up to 100 000 mentally ill people, including 5000 children, were killed in Nazi Germany. In the course of the Nazi regime, over 400 000 forced sterilisations took place, mainly of people with mental illnesses. Other countries, including Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland, had active forced sterilisation programmes and eugenics laws. Similar laws were implemented in the USA, with up to 25 000 forced sterilisations. These atrocities were enabled and facilitated by psychiatrists of the time and are only one example of the dark side of the profession. This article reviews some of these aspects of the history of psychiatry, including Germany's eugenics programme and the former USSR's detention of dissidents under the guise of psychiatric treatment.

> ‚ÄòMen (wretched creatures that they are) worry less about doing an injury to one who makes himself loved than to one who makes himself feared‚Äô (The Prince, Niccolo Machiavelli, 1532).

> The objective of this article is to familiarise mental health professionals and lay readers with the rather colourful and disdainful history of psychiatry, particularly the political abuses of mental health legislation. The debate about legislative changes (including legislation for ‚Äòdangerous severe personality disorder‚Äô in the UK) often seems arcane and unnecessary until set in the context of these historical abuses of the mental health system.

> Some psychiatrists have abused power in general. For example, although the war crimes for which Radovan Karad≈æiƒá is currently standing trial do not arise from his psychiatric practice, it is salutary to note that he is far from being the first psychiatrist to be accused (or convicted) of crimes against humanity. However, Thomas Szasz controversially argued that there is something inherent in psychiatry, particularly the power to restrict liberty, that tends towards abuse if not regulated by the legal or political system. In the past, there have been abuses of psychiatrists‚Äô powers to detain people, but these have been instigated at the direction of governments such as that in Nazi Germany (leading to genocide of mentally ill people) and the USSR (where political dissidents were detained with a diagnosis of ‚Äòsluggish schizophrenia‚Äô).

[The World Psychiatry Association](https://www.wpanet.org/) has a new code of ethics [2020/OGA/7](pdf/e172f3_4cecd522c2d448c7944342ba88c527e5.pdf)

The Declaration of Hawaii issued by the World Psychiatric Association in 1977 and updated in 1983 in Vienna was initiated because of political abuse of psychiatry in some countries in the seventies. This led to a long process of investigation and concern within the domain of professional ethics and paved the way for the Declaration of Madrid, which was endorsed by the General Assembly of the World Psychiatric Association in Madrid in 1996.

In its final form, the Declaration of Madrid includes seven general guidelines that focus on the aims of psychiatry namely to treat mentally ill patients, prevent mental illness, promote mental health and provide care and rehabilitation for mentally ill patients.

The Declaration of Madrid has now been superseded by the 2020 WPA Code of Ethics.

> Principle 1: Beneficence - Psychiatrists provide competent and compassionate medical care with devotion to the interests of their patients.

> Principle 2: Respect for patients' autonomy - Psychiatrists are especially mindful of respect for patients autonomy given their statutory role in treating a proportion of their patients compulsory. Compulsory treatment may be justified where a less restrictive intervention can not achieve safe and adequate care; its purpose is ultimately to promote safe and re-establish patients' autonomy and welfare.

> Principle 3: Non Maleficence - Psychiatrists avoid actions that may be injurious to their patients.

> Principle 4: Improving standards of mental health care and psychiatric practice: Psychiatrists recognize a responsibility to promote the continuing development of their profession and their personal professional development.

> Principle 5: Applying psychiatric expertise to the service of society - Psychiatrists, like other physicians, utilize their specialized knowledge and skills to promote mental health and wellbeing of persons who may be vulnerable to mental illness.

The electrifying, forgotten history of Robert Heath's brain pacemaker, investigating the origins and ethics of one of today's most promising medical breakthroughs: deep brain stimulation

> The technology invented by psychiatrist Robert G. Heath in the 1950s and '60s has been described as among the most controversial experiments in US history. His work was alleged at the time to be part of MKUltra, the CIA's notorious "mind control" project. His research subjects included incarcerated convicts and gay men who wished to be "cured" of their sexual preference. Yet his cutting-edge research and legacy were quickly buried deep in Tulane University's archives. Investigative science journalist Lone Frank now tells the complete sage of this passionate, determined doctor and his groundbreaking neuroscience.

> More than fifty years after Heath's experiments, this very same treatment is becoming mainstream practice in modern psychiatry for everything from schizophrenia, anorexia, and compulsive behavior to depression, Parkinson's, and even substance addiction.

> Lone Frank uncovered lost documents and accounts of Heath's trailblazing work. She tracked down surviving colleagues and patients, and she delved into the current support for deep brain stimulation by scientists and patients alike. What has changed? Why do we today unquestioningly embrace this technology as a cure? How do we decide what is a disease of the brain to be cured and what should be allowed to remain unrobed and unprodded? And how do we weigh the decades of criticism against the promise of treatment that could be offered to millions of patients?

> Elegantly written and deeply fascinating, The Pleasure Shock weaves together biography, scientific history, and medical ethics. It is an adventure into our ever-shifting views of the mind and the fateful power we wield when we tinker with the self.

Publicly disclosed information in the field of [Neuroscience](https://www.cell.com/neuron/pdf/S0896-6273(18)30011-4.pdf) has been made available and awareness to alternative therapeutic approaches to conventional pharmacotherapy such as the use of [electroceuticals](https://www.darpa.mil/program/electrical-prescriptions) is being raised!

![](img/electrxhasth.png)

> The Electrical Prescriptions (ElectRx) program aims to support military operational readiness by reducing the time to treatment, logistical challenges, and potential off-target effects associated with traditional medical interventions for a wide range of physical and mental health conditions commonly faced by our warfighters. ElectRx seeks to deliver non-pharmacological treatments for pain, general inflammation, post-traumatic stress, severe anxiety, and trauma that employ precise, closed-loop, non-invasive modulation of the patient‚Äôs peripheral nervous system.

> The human nervous system already plays a vital role in maintaining all aspects of physical and mental health. A sophisticated network of sensory nerves continuously monitors health status and triggers reflexive responses in the brain and spinal cord when an infection or injury is detected. These reflexes normally adjust organ function to initiate and control the healing process. However, some diseases can disrupt healthy functioning of these processes and produce nerve signaling that causes pain, metabolic disorders such as diabetes, and autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis. ElectRx technology would exploit and supplement the body‚Äôs natural ability to quickly and effectively heal itself, intervening when required to correct or bolster nervous system activity.

> ElectRx is establishing the underlying science and developing the technologies that could enable artificial modulation of peripheral nerves to restore healthy patterns of signaling in these neural circuits. The program seeks to advance understanding of the anatomy and physiology of specific neural circuits and their role in health and disease. In parallel, the program also seeks to develop novel biological-interface technologies for monitoring biomarkers and peripheral nerve activity, and delivering therapeutic signals to peripheral nerve targets. Potential new approaches include in vivo, real-time biosensors and novel neural interfaces using optical, acoustic, electromagnetic, or engineered biology strategies to achieve precise targeting with potentially single-axon resolution.

> Following successes in early proof-of-concept studies, the ElectRx devices and therapeutic systems under development are entering into clinical studies. If successful, such precise neuromodulation capability technology would reduce dependence on traditional drugs and create new treatments that could be automatically and continuously tuned to the needs of warfighters without side effects. The technology could also help doctors evaluate and predict various physiological states, and characterize host response in patients with severe infections, providing a quantitative framework to guide operations and therapy.

## [Computational Psychiatry](https://www.technologyreview.com/2017/07/21/242297/the-emerging-science-of-computational-psychiatry/)

Psychiatry, the study and prevention of mental disorders, is currently undergoing a quiet revolution. For decades, even centuries, this discipline has been based largely on subjective observation. Large-scale studies have been hampered by the difficulty of objectively assessing human behavior and comparing it with a well-established norm. Just as tricky, there are few well-founded models of neural circuitry or brain biochemistry, and it is difficult to link this science with real-world behavior.

That has begun to change thanks to the emerging discipline of computational psychiatry, which uses powerful data analysis, machine learning, and artificial intelligence to tease apart the underlying factors behind extreme and unusual behaviors. ¬†

Computational psychiatry has suddenly made it possible to mine data from long-standing observations and link it to mathematical theories of cognition. It‚Äôs also become possible to develop computer-based experiments that carefully control environments so that specific behaviors can be studied in detail.

## [Justice Reform](https://scilaw.org/)

Social stratification by directing violence towards women and my own parents resulting in abuse of threat assessment systems like [**MOSAIC**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOSAIC_threat_assessment_systems) is both repugnant and [fascist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism)!

Perhaps it may be a good idea to have the Police set the right example and stop themselves from engaging in acts of Police brutality by creating a cultural movement via diffusion to set us away from these mediocre standards so the general population can simultaneously feel safer and accept the higher standards about to be set by neurolaw via bringing neuroscience and machine learning to the field of [neurolaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurolaw) for the purpose of [presenting evidence for legal proceedings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence_(law)).

Maybe this would help address the many shortcomings of law enforcement, help reduce their workload, eradicate tampering, falsification, and spoliation of evidence and keep the general population away from penitentiaries and psychiatric hospitals!

The cybertorture medium used to direct violence towards women could be used to help law enforcement avoid engaging in acts of police brutality as those that gave rise to the [BLM movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter) and many others like [Cl√°udia Sim√µes in Portugal](https://expresso.pt/sociedade/2020-01-24-Claudia-Simoes-Se-nao-lhe-mordesse-a-mao-e-o-braco-morreria.-Ele-estava-a-sufocar-me.-Nao-morri-sabe-Deus-como).

Within the context of the Holy Trinity, God (the father) is everything, not an anthropomorphic alien species that may have interacted with primates in the past to create humankind, or any other very low probability hypothesis of intelligent design creationism which would be nothing more than a subset of God (the Father) as the SUPERSET - Everything (which encompasses the Universe, said aliens species and accounts for events reffered to as "miracles of creation") making the whole Great Architect of the Universe concept being associated to God (the father) sound idiotic and irrational!

It does not mean God is a ludicrous delusional concept of God as a Great Architect of the Universe (no less) in the ancient candle light of Saint Thomas Aquinas, and most definitely does not mean a compass and square was used or that western society should be stratified by megalomaniac fools stratifying society as if they were keepers of knowledge or these "Great Architects of the Universe" themselves which amounts to Heresy!

Since in Portugal most Freemasonry lodges claim to be Catholic and the Holy Trinity is crucial to that theme have you considered discussing reform so that the whole thing sounds less megalomaniac and delusional ? Perhaps something more humble would make sense like proposing the letter G standing for God and not GAU, GADU, GAOTU or any other such nonsense with direct associations to the theme of architecture, insinuating current catholic freemasons should act as keepers of knowledge and in the context of history of freemasonry.

Being transparent and making scientific research results public knowledge (keeping as close as possible to an open source like model) and updating the tools used (compass and square) to something more relevant to modern society and still in the context of God (The Holy Spirit) as those who protect life (immaculate conception) and craft acts of goodwill.

Tools relevant to context specific areas (drafting legislation, enforcing the law, pursuit of knowledge, and providing medical treatment to those who need it) will help!

Acting as keepers of knowledge for decades and participating in cybertorture circus spectacles to stratify society whilst acting in criminal association with members of crucial parts of society such as law enforcement officers, the justice system, medical doctors, etc and collaborationist clowns, hiding the procedure under a veil of psychiatric fraud and false therapy via forced pharmacotherapy whilst treating people as if they were "the ignorati" as Emile Barkof did by insinuating I didn't know "how things work at the neurotransmitter level" does not help in the context of the WPA 2020 code of ethics

Many of us could have our psychopathologies and addictions addressed and quality of life significantly improved by self-rewarding neuromodulation payloads in a quasi-continuous closed feedback loop, using the same cybertorture medium!

Perhaps it would be a good idea for psychiatrists to tattoo these principles in their gluteus maximus prior to engaging in attempts of therapy with any patient!

Further, given the introduction of "Internet Gaming Addiction" in DSM-V and the usage of synthetic telepathy to perform political propaganda, along with the common partidary mentality to further political party agendas, common to so many elected government representatives in the world of politics, which is a clear sign of addiction to political cooperative games that lead to suboptimal results in the context of system dynamics and the betterment of humanity as a whole. It may be of use to propose "Partidary Cooperative Gaming Addiction" to the WHO!

Cybertorture and Cybersodomy have been set as standard extrajudicial sentences in our society, and I believe Sodomy should be seen in the biblical sense, i.e.

> Modern scholarship, particularly in Judaism and certain branches of Christianity, has proposed that it is the inhabitants‚Äô lack of hospitality, not their homosexuality, that gives offence to God. According to this view, the mob‚Äôs demands to rape the angelic guests reveals their deep-seated violence and inhospitality and is meant to stand in striking contrast to the gracious hospitality given by both Abraham and Lot to those same strangers. To further this claim, some cite the words of Jesus in Matthew 10:14‚Äì15:

It's seems the Acronym GAU is more suited to fight anti-sodomy legislation in those 72 regions were being gay is still illegal and using it under the moniker "Great Architects of Uranus"

Given the way in which me and my family have been treated for the past few decades and the letter I received from the Openbaar Ministerie in the Netherlands requesting compulsory care it's parentory now is too late and I shall be forced to seek extrication of my mother from that hellhole fascist country you rule with an [iron fist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXKrBTYGY_M) and attempt to leave the European Union with her and attempt to find peace elsewhere hoping you will stop squaring my anus!
