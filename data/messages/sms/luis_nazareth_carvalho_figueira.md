This is an emergency request for humanitarian help to address the abuses of Portuguese police officers linked to Colégio Militar

Several Portuguese police officers who behave like mafiosi linked to Colégio Militar (largo da Luz, Lisbon, Portugal) act as if they were gods above the law directing violence towards parents women and children, creating drug addicts with synthetic pain, setting cyber torture and cybersodomy as standard extrajudicial sentences.

These cowards are protected by elected government officials, the police and the armed forces and make whole families stab themselves and jump out of the window, whilst remotely break teeth of whole families to force them into submission.

Indivduals like Tito Enrico Miranda Fernandes, Pedro Miguel Grilo and Luis Nazareth Carvalho Figueira are some of the most dangerous international criminals and psychopaths who entertain themselves forcing their victims to feel sexually abused and sodomized whilst delivering putrid vibrotactile payloads of kisses of death to the skull of their victims as they try to force them to commit suicide like poets of death and human degradation.

These individuals are connected to Portuguese law enforcement and I’m afraid the threat won’t be addressed until they are killed like the mad dogs they are :(
