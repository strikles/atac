Dear Sir/Madam

Cybertorture is recognized by the United Nations under A/HRC/43/49 and is used in grotesque rituals of social stratification (by cowardly col√©gio militar alumni who bring the fine institution founded in 1803 to new lows and self-entitled and corrupt law enforcement officers and known criminals recruited to divert attention) to exact extrajudicial trials and sentences as an interactive spectacle encouraging participation, mongering tensions and hatred by preying on cognitive biases.

Those who exact the extrajudicial sentences resort to directing violence towards women, parents, creating drug addicts with synthetic pain and forcing acts of self-harm for entertainment, whilst attempting to portray themselves as Artists of human degradation, social stratification and self-harm, with grotesque preludes of vibrotactile and sonic payloads of "kisses" and setting synthetic pain, articulating tongue and jaw of the subject under torture, cyber sodomy, intercourse sabotage in males (via involuntary perineum contractions resorting to forced using a feather) and vibrotactile genital abuse in females (possibly resulting in Stockholm's Syndrome) as being standard in our society!

The procedure is hidden under a veil of medical malpractice via psychiatric fraud (violating every principle in the code of ethics set by the World Psychiatry Association), false therapy in the form of forced conventional pharmacotherapy (with an associated high risk of suicide) when it could be used to provide therapeutic payloads via the same medium, raising feelings of paranoia towards remote healthcare, neural engineering and electroceuticals where the risk of suicide would be nearly zero!

Since Cybertorture paired with Psychiatric Fraud and False therapy has been used for quite some time now to stratify society and several people complained about the installation of such an art piece at an emergency psychiatric institution that deals with individuals at risk of committing acts of self-harm and Wim Brands committed suicide, may I humbly request the name of the statue "How to meet an Angel" to be renamed to something that doesn't make it seem like suicide is a recipe to meet Angels ?

Here follows some of my cybertorture and psychiatric abuse story
