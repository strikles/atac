Óscar António Piçarra de Castro Graça is a sadist who ravels in exacting extrajudicial vibrotactile cybertorture sentences to generate psychotic behavior, repeatedly gambling genital self-mutilation (all day and night for over a year) and mongering hatred between people, towards Christianity and Islam whilst both religions are ridiculed with endless faith trials which prey on cognitive biases of the watching crowd over differences between both like the crucifixion of Jesus

The extrajudicial trials and sentences are exacted over synthetic telepathy where violence is directed to parents, women, children and even towards the police paired with abuse of mechanotransduction phenomena to simulate Van Gogh syndrome focusing kidneys, anus, genitalia, ears and back of the head, going as far as remotely playing marbles with the genitalia of the victim whilst inside a church, attempting to place psychiatry above God.

Óscar António Piçarra de Castro Graça has been planning to force me into a prison cell, a psychiatric hospital or into suicide in stochastic proximity games of vibrotactile cybertorture, intercourse sabotage and abuse of synthetic telepathy in the vicinity of would be victims of directed violence picking women and my parents as his main targets since I was a teenager student at Colégio Militar for refusing to leave the school when invited in 1993.

Convict Óscar António Piçarra de Castro Graça for attempted murder and place him in a cushioned room wearing a straight jacket in a psychiatric prison hospital!
