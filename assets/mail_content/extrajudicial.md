I don't want to teach, I want to learn. I've never been good at teaching, nor did I have that desire and under cognitive impairment all I can do is use Ctrl^C and Ctrl^V which doesn't allow for much learning! Instead of the current illegal sentence of perpetual cognitive impairment via cybertorture, being forced to live in synthetic states of anxiety, depression or psychosis whilst under sleep deprivation, continue smoking tobacco and drinking coffee or roam the streets and spend all my money to provide barganing for relief content for a morbid interactive torture spectacle, resulting in medical malpractice via psychiatric fraud, false therapy via forced conventional anti-psychotic pharmacotherapy and a misclassification of **paranoid schizophrenia** I would like to be able to:

#### [*"Cogito, ergo sum"*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum#The_Search_for_Truth)
> Cogito, ergo sum is a philosophical statement that was made in Latin by René Descartes, usually translated into English as "I think, therefore I am". The phrase originally appeared in French as je pense, donc je suis in his Discourse on the Method, so as to reach a wider audience than Latin would have allowed. It appeared in Latin in his later Principles of Philosophy. As Descartes explained it, "we cannot doubt of our existence while we doubt." A fuller version, articulated by Antoine Léonard Thomas, aptly captures Descartes's intent: dubito, ergo cogito, ergo sum ("I doubt, therefore I think, therefore I am"). The dictum is also sometimes referred to as the cogito.

> Descartes's statement became a fundamental element of Western philosophy, as it purported to provide a certain foundation for knowledge in the face of radical doubt. While other knowledge could be a figment of imagination, deception, or mistake, Descartes asserted that the very act of doubting one's own existence served—at minimum—as proof of the reality of one's own mind; there must be a thinking entity—in this case the self—for there to be a thought.

#### [*"I feel, therefore I am"*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descartes%27_Error)
> In his 1994 book **Descartes' Error: Emotion, Reason, and the Human Brain** [António Damásio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Damasio) presents the ["somatic marker hypothesis"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic_marker_hypothesis), a proposed mechanism by which emotions guide (or [bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases)) behavior and decision-making, and positing that rationality requires emotional input. He argues that [René Descartes'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes) "error" was the dualist separation of mind and body, rationality and emotion.
