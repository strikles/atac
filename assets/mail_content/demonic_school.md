Colégio Militar alumni led by Luis Nazareth Carvalho Figueira and others are a systemic threat infecting society with extrajudicial cybertorture sentences!

They entertaiNed themselves since 1996 direction violence to women and my parents and sabotaging intercourse with involuntary perineum contractions, conspired to turn me into a drug addict, remotely broke my teeth (and I suspect my parents teeth too) and cybersodomized us all trying to force us into suicide or psychiatric care

Please close down Colegio militar (largo da luz, Portugal) and bar “A Capela” in Bairro Alto (Lisbon, Portugal) owned by Pedro Silva
