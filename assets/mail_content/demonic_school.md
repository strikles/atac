Dear Sir/Madam

Colégio Militar alumni led by Luis Nazareth Carvalho Figueira, José Ricardo Nazareth Carvalho Figueira, Pedro Miguel Grilo and Tito Eurico Miranda Fernandes amongst many others are a systemic threat infecting society and current Colegio Militar students with their extrajudicial cybertorture sentences, in my case for refusing to leave Colegio Militar with top grades, hence setting the worst kind of example!

They entertained themselves since 1996 directing violence to women and my parents, sabotaging intercourse with involuntary perineum contractions in rituals involving the use of a feather, conspired to turn me into a drug addict with cybersodomy, tried to force me to castrate myself day and night since the summer of 2016 with vibrotactil genital Cybertorture, remotely broke my teeth (and I suspect my parents teeth too) and cybersodomized us all trying to force us into suicide or psychiatric care

Please help close down Colegio militar (largo da luz, Portugal)
