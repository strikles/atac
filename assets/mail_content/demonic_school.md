Dear Sir/Madam

Colégio Militar alumni have been setting standards of mediocrity and creating fascist psychopaths in law enforcement and the armed forces who have been involved in crafting synthetic “human trash” social stratification schemes and simulating mental illness with cybertorture extrajudicial trials and sentences for nearly 30 years destroying whole families and turning its members against each other to satisfy whims, entertained themselves remotely articulating tongues and jaws to force people to talk to themselves, forced people to regurgitate, defecate and urinate themselves, directed violence to children, parents and women, remotely broke teeth like cowards, set cybersodomy and vibrotactile cybertorture to simulate Van Gogh syndrome via abuse of mechanotransduction phenomena as a standard extrajudicial sentence and threatened whole families with forced incarceration and psychiatric commitments as extrajudicial methods of intimidation…

Further social stratification schemes and mediocrity standards became common place by making plagiarism a standard in the school via a tradition of passing school keys from year to year to steal exams!

Sign the petition to either close Colégio Militar (largo da Luz, Portugal) or reform and bring dignity to the school…
