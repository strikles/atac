### Motivation



<p align="center" width="100%"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strikles/atac-data/main/messages/assets/img/jesus/jesus_king.png"></p>


several colégio militar (largo da luz, lisbon, portugal) former students linked to portuguese law enforcement are sitting in a room everyday, taking turns at forcing people to talk to themselves, hurt themselves, trying to force synthetic psychosis onto their victims whenever they are near other people, to use them as targets of directed violence. these targets could be elderly parents at the end of their life, women,  children and even handicapped people. They wake me up daily, in the middle of the night or early in the morning in a ritual of articulating my tongue and trying to force me hurt myself (ears, head and genitals) and break everything I own, by abusing biophotonics, in a manner similar to the soviet style murder of mathew puncher.


<p align="center" width="100%"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strikles/atac-data/main/messages/assets/img/matthew_puncher.png"></p>


these individuals create drug addicts with synthetic pain, setting cybertorture and cybersodomy as extrajudicial punishment in order to force people to hurt themselves (head, anus and genitals) with relentless vibrotactile cybertorture to force the victim to bargain for relief and to complete the tasks they are issued via synthetic telepathy and act ìn criminal association with multiple others like the group of individuals below.

Here follows another group:

<p align="center" width="100%"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strikles/atac-data/main/messages/assets/img/others/joao_leiria.png"></p>


cybertorture is recognized under A/HRC/43/49 by the United Nations and is used in grotesque extrajudicial punishment rituals for the purpose of social stratification, as an interactive spectacle encouraging participation, with the intent of accumulating hatred, by preying on cognitive biases of those recruited to execute the extrajudicial punishment.


<p align="center" width="100%"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strikles/atac-data/main/messages/assets/img/jesus/golgota.png"></p>


they abuse biophotonics to execute extrajudicial punishment, resorting to directing violence towards women, parents and children, creating drug addicts with synthetic pain and risking forcing acts of self harm onto others for entertainment, attempting to portray themselves as artists of human degradation, social stratification and self harm, with grotesque vibrotactile and sonic payloads of "kisses", setting synthetic pain, articulation of tongue and jaw of the victim, cybersodomy, sex sabotage in males (via vibrotactile torture to induce forced perineum contractions) and genital abuse in females (possibly resulting in stockholm syndrome) as being commonplace in our society!


<p align="center" width="100%"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strikles/atac-data/main/messages/assets/img/jesus/jesus_lamb.png"></p>


they are connected to ricardo rebordão de brito [^1], rui goncalo pires pintado [^2], luis nazareth carvalho figueira [^3], pedro miguel de brito esteves grilo [^4], joão filipe saraiva pinheiro [^5], pedro de queiroz antão [^6], ricardo carrilho [^7], paulo jorge varanda [^8], frederico ferronha [^19], oscar ferreira [^10], thyago picco [^11], rui ricardo borges marques sabino reino [^12], pedro nuno da silva rocha [^13], tito eurico miranda fernandes [^14].

some of these former colégio militar students are linked to famous music stars you may know: adolfo luxúria canibal [^15] and manuel joão vieira [^16]

<p align="center" width="100%"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strikles/atac-data/main/messages/assets/img/alumni/alc.png"></p>


they spend every day inside a room taking turns at trying to get me to stab my head and genitalia in an alternate fashion, repeating the phrases and simultaneously engaging in orgies and greeting each others as if it was a normal social event. 


<p align="center" width="100%"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strikles/atac-data/main/messages/assets/img/jesus/jesus_cross.png"></p>


others were recruited at jardim adamastor in lisbon and bairro alto to spend all day repeating phrases like parrots:


* "desisto"
* "estas a ver o que a casa gasta"
* "nao gostamos dele"
* "vai-te foder com essa conversa de merda"
* "com quem te meteste"


<p align="center" width="100%"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strikles/atac-data/main/messages/assets/img/jesus/stella_maris.png"></p>


i fled portugal to avoid the blue whale suicide game that was forced upon me and my family by colégio militar former students and this group of sadistic cowards pursued me to the netherlands, trying to force me to return to portugal, so they could use my mother as a target of violence and gamble my suicide in front of her to force me into a jail cell or a psychiatric hospital, for having refused to leave colégio militar and threatening exposure of the events in the news in 1996.


<p align="center" width="100%"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strikles/atac-data/main/messages/assets/img/jesus/holy_spirit.png"></p>


they have been trying to portrait me as a homophobe, a xenophobe, a rapist an addict, a drug dealer, a pimp and even a pedophile in criminal association with netherlands law enforcement and criminal associates of jasper kums, with extrajudicial punishment, all day, mutiple times perminute (if not per second) since the summer of 2016.


<p align="center" width="100%"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strikles/atac-data/main/messages/assets/img/jesus/rafael.png"></p>


multiple of the recruited sadists entertain themselves forcing their victims to feel sexually abused and sodomized, delivering putrid vibrotactile payloads of "kisses of death" to the head of their victims, as they try to force their victims to hurt themselves repeatedly, like poets of death and human degradation.


<p align="center" width="100%"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strikles/atac-data/main/messages/assets/img/jesus/monk.png"></p>


they were enabled to destroy their victims and respective households, with family members of the victims also being targeted and having their teeth broken remotely by cowards. they will force the families of their victims to feel sexually abused by abusing biophotonics, in order to force their victims into psychiatric submission, whilst simultaneously generating human degradation content for a closed circuit interactive spectacle, encouraging participation, so the players take turns executing extrajudicial cybertorture, articulating tongues and delivering vibrotactile punishment and synthetic pain to simulate mental illness.


<p align="center" width="100%"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strikles/atac-data/main/messages/assets/img/jesus/crucifixion_jesus_mary.png"></p>


they act via recruited criminal associates [^17], [^18], [^19], [^20], [^21], [^22], [^23], [^24], [^25], [^26], [^27], [^28], [^29], [^30] to execute their extrajudicial punishment, in an attempt to coerce incarceration, psychiatry or self-harm as a gamble, going as far as systematically directing violence towards people who are physically near me, having a special interest on women.


<p align="center" width="100%"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strikles/atac-data/main/messages/assets/img/others/joel.png"></p>


the procedure is hidden with medical malpractice via psychiatric fraud and false therapy (in the form of forced conventional pharmacotherapy, with a high risk of suicide) when the same medium could be used to provide real therapy. Instead they raise feelings of paranoia towards biophotonics, remote healthcare, neural engineering and bioelectric medicine (where the risk of suicide would be negligible)


<p align="center" width="100%"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strikles/atac-data/main/messages/assets/img/jesus/imaculate_heart.png"></p>


governments worldwide are denying us neurorights, whilst a synthetic hell on hearth is created as a demonic psychiatric circus, where life is gambled with vibrotactile cybertorture to induce synthetic psychosis and feelings of self harm in a interactive spectacle, where participants take turns to gamble self-harm and even suicide of their victims, in snuff show style" suicide games that inspire so much hatred and anger amongst the population and which is are of the reasons that led to war in ukraine.


<p align="center" width="100%"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strikles/atac-data/main/messages/assets/img/jesus/adam_tree_of_life.png"></p>


until neurorights legislation is passed, it is likely you will continue seeing more and more homeless people talking to themselves, scenes of domestic violence on your television screens with multiple families being destroyed in sadistic rituals of ostentation of control over the physiology of others against their will via abuse of biophotonics, photoacoustics, and thermoacoustics to execute cybertorture.


<p align="center" width="100%"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strikles/atac-data/main/messages/assets/img/books/homo_sovieticus.png"></p>


* say yes to neurorights
* say no to the "homo sovieticus" initiative of pairing cybertorture with blue whale suicide games covered up with psychiatric fraud
