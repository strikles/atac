##### The current scraping algorithm is the following
```markdown
P ← starting URLs (primary queue) 
S ← ∅ (secondary queue)
V ← ∅ (visited pages)
while P ≠ ∅ do
    Pick a page v from P and download it
    V ← V ∪ {v} (mark as visited)
    N+(v) ← v’s out-links pointing to new pages (“new” means not in P, S or V)
    if |N+(v)| > t then
        R ← first t out-links N+(v)
        S ← S ∪ (v)

### Motivation


<p align="center" width="100%"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strikles/atac-data/main/messages/assets/img/jesus/jesus_king.png"></p>


Both my father and my father worked for 3 decades as judicial clerks in portuguese courts, to be used, at the end of their life, as targets against which to direct violence, by colegio militar alumni and the individuals they recruited linked to Tiago Santos Sousa, with psychiatrist Emile Barkhof visiting the location where Ricardo Rebordão de Brito, Ivo Francisco, Eduardo Metzner, Luis Muskiado and criminal associates are. 


<p align="center" width="100%"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strikles/atac-data/main/messages/assets/img/alumni/rrb.png"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strikles/atac-data/main/messages/assets/img/others/paulinho.png"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strikles/atac-data/main/messages/assets/img/others/muskiado.png"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strikles/atac-data/main/messages/assets/img/others/jose_teixeira.png"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strikles/atac-data/main/messages/assets/img/others/tiago_roque.png"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strikles/atac-data/main/messages/assets/img/others/jasper_kums.png"></p>


instead of denouncing these individuals Emile Barkhof is systematically attempting to coverup up the cybertorture procedure to perpetuate human degradation psychiatric spectacles trying to force me into psychiatry and forced pharmacotherapy at any cost to pass me as a schizophrenic and make an example out of me, presenting false testimony in a court of law, using falsified reports of risk to self and refusal to take medication against my will as justifications for the damages inflicted by the group of individuals recruited to exact the extrajudicial cybertorture sentences. 


<p align="center" width="100%"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strikles/atac-data/main/messages/assets/img/psychiatrists/2_emile.png"></p>


colegio militar (largo da luz, lisbon, portugal) alumni linked to pedro miguel de brito esteves grilo @psp, rui gonçalo pires pintado, and recruited criminal associates of jose teixeira (bar crew hassan), tiago jorge roque, gonçalo bandeira duarte, ivo francisco, arthur moreno, carla maria marinho rodrigues, luskiado, a capoverdian known as "calo", tania borboleta and many others, incarnate colonialism time demons by spending their days abusing biophotonics to exact cybertorture trials and sentences for everything in the book with a main focus on xenophobia, inducing synthetic states of psychosis, forcing me into roaming the streets since they wake me up daily, in the middle of the night or early in the morning, with vibrotactile cybertorture.


<p align="center" width="100%"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strikles/atac-data/main/messages/assets/img/jesus/jesus_lamb.png"></p>


They engage in a daily ritual of articulating my tongue with the words "psychiatrist", "psychiatry" and "medication" while sodomizing me and torturing me genitally to create a piling psychological antagonistic effect and monger hatred, increasing the odds of directed violence towards psychiatrists and medical staff in a clinical scenario.


<p align="center" width="100%"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strikles/atac-data/main/messages/assets/img/others/others.gif"></p>


Simultaneously, dutch psychiatrist Emile Barkhof (who has visited the location where this group of individuals exact their extrajudicial cybertorture sentences) along with elected government officials who watch the human degradation spectacle and instead of denouncing it on the news, or reporting it to the police, watch the macabre spectacle as a "casa dos degredos" blue whale style suicide game similar to mathew puncher's soviet-style murder, where I am issued tasks such as "breaking my phone, my laptop and mutilating my penis" in the portuguese language, and forced to pick between:


1. returning to portugal being cybersodomized and genitally abused with my tongue being articulated in portuguese, where colegio militar alumni linked to pedro miguel de brito esteves grilo @psp induce psychosis in the physical vicinity of my parents to coerce me into psychiatric care as a humiliation, directing violence to my parents all day to gamble futures of suicide, homicide, incarceration of forced psychiatric care. 

2. staying in the netherlands and being forced into a psychiatric asylum under "assisted living" after losing my home with Eefje Suk, Emile Barkhof and Sara Hoff presenting falsified opinions in a court of law of rejection of pharmacotherapy and "risk to self" to coerce psychiatric care and forced pharmacotherapy against my will instead of denouncing the individuals above along with their location.

3. being forced into a jail cell and losing my home and my freedom whilst being abused to induce psychosis with people around me being used as targets of directed violence.


<p align="center" width="100%"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strikles/atac-data/main/messages/assets/img/jesus/rafael.png"></p>


These individuals present themselves as artists of human degradation, social stratification and self-inflicted harm, with vibrotactile and sonic payloads of "kisses", establishing simulated van gogh syndrome, synthetic pain, tongue and jaw articulation, cybersodomy, sexual sabotage in males (vibrotactile torture to induce forced contractions to the perineum) and sexual abuse in women (possibly resulting in stockholm syndrome) as common in our society!


<p align="center" width="100%"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strikles/atac-data/main/messages/assets/img/jesus/jesus_bound.png"></p>


They create drug addicts with synthetic pain, establishing cybersodomy as standard extrajudicial sentences, to force the victim to seek relief and complete issued by abusing the photoacoustic and thermoacoustic effects.


<p align="center" width="100%"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strikles/atac-data/main/messages/assets/img/jesus/golgota.png"></p>


These individuals are connected to ricardo rebordão de brito [^1], rui goncalo pires painted [^2], luis nazareth carvalho figueira [^3], cesar cristovão, pedro miguel de brito esteves grilo [^4], joão filipe saraiva pinheiro [^5 ], pedro de queiroz antão [^6], ricardo carrilho [^7], paulo jorge varanda [^8], frederico ferronha [^19], oscar ferreira [^10], thyago picco [^11], rui ricardo borges marque sabino reino [^12], pedro nuno da silva rocha [^13], tito eurico miranda fernandes [^14], frederico leitão and carlos anselmo simões. Other Colegio Militar alumni stars are linked to the famous music stars you know: adolfo luxuria cannibal [^15] and manuel joão vieira [^16]


<p align="center" width="100%"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strikles/atac-data/main/messages/assets/img/alumni/alumni.gif"></p>


These individuals spend their days in a room, trying to induce psychosis, targeting head and genitalia in an alternate fashion, every few seconds, repeating phrases to articulate my tongue and jaw, whilst engaging in orgies, greeting each others as they if it was a normal social event.


<p align="center" width="100%"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strikles/atac-data/main/messages/assets/img/jesus/jesus_color.png"></p>


Other individuals were recruited at jardim adamastor in lisbon and bairro alto to spend all day repeating phrases like parrots:

* "Desisto"
* "Estás a ver o que a casa gasta"
* "Não gostamos dele"
* "Vai-te foder com essa conversa de merda"
* "com quem te meteste"


<p align="center" width="100%"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strikles/atac-data/main/messages/assets/img/jesus/stella_maris.png"></p>


I fled portugal more than once to avoid the extrajudicial sentences of colegio militar alumni and recruited criminal associates as interactive cybertorture spectacle of abusing biophotonics, thermoacoustics and photoacoustics instead of social media to issue tasks). this "blue whale suicide game" was forced upon me and my family by alumni of the colegio militar and criminal associates in 1993. this group of sadistic cowards chased me to england in 1996 and the netherlands in 2013, trying to force me to return to portugal systematically.


<p align="center" width="100%"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strikles/atac-data/main/messages/assets/img/jesus/holy_spirit.png"></p>


For refusing to leave colegio militar in 1993 when invited and by threatening exposure of events in the news in 1996 these individuals has been trying to portray me as violent against women, homophobic, xenophobic, a drug addict, a drug dealer, and even a pedophile and a rapist in criminal association with jasper kums, with extrajudicial sentences, all day, several times a minute (if not per second) since the summer of 2016. 


<p align="center" width="100%"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strikles/atac-data/main/messages/assets/img/jesus/monk.png"></p>


Several of the sadists recruited have fun forcing their victims to feel sexually abused and sodomized, providing rotten vibrotactile payloads of "kisses of death" to the head of their victims, while trying to force their victims to hurt themselves repeatedly in front of an audience, like poets of death and human degradation.


<p align="center" width="100%"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strikles/atac-data/main/messages/assets/img/jesus/crucifixion_jesus_mary.png"></p>


These individuals were enabled to destroy life (even whole families if necessary as in my case) forcing their victims to feel sexually abused in order to coerce psychiatric submission with simulated van gogh syndrome syndrome, as a threat, while simultaneously generating human degradation content for an interactive closed circuit spectacle, encouraging participation, so that players take turns exacting extrajudicial sentences of cybertorture, articulating tongues and providing vibrotactile and synthetic pain to simulate psychosis and other forms of psychiatric illness.


<p align="center" width="100%"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strikles/atac-data/main/messages/assets/img/jesus/jesus_carrying_cross.png"></p>


These individuals act through recruited criminals such as joel da fonte, cátia lopes, filipa sequeira among many others [^17], [^18], [^19], [^20], [^21], [^ 22], [^23], [^24], [^25], [^26], [^27], [^28], [^29], [^30] to perform the extrajudicial sentences systematically directing violence against people who are physically close, having a special interest in inducing psychosis and directing violence towards medical staff, women and my parents.


<p align="center" width="100%"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strikles/atac-data/main/messages/assets/img/jesus/log.png"><

The procedure is hidden with falsified medical diagnosis, forced pharmacotherapy against the will of the recipient (in the form of forced conventional pharmacotherapy, with high risk of suicide) and piling psychological effects such as articulating the tongue of the subject under torture with the words "psychiatrist", "psychiatry" and "medication", to draw antagonism towards psychiatry, pharmacotherapy and medical staff and increase the odds of foul play, or me being forced to flee the netherlands against my will.


<p align="center" width="100%"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strikles/atac-data/main/messages/assets/img/psychiatrists/psychiatrists.gif"></p>


The very same technological means used to exact cybertorture extrajudicial sentences could provide real therapy for those in need. instead, these individuals raise feelings of paranoia towards biophotonics, remote medical care, neural engineering and bioelectric medicine (where the risk of suicide would be insignificant to conventional pharmacotherapy in comparison).


<p align="center" width="100%"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strikles/atac-data/main/messages/assets/img/books/books.gif"></p>


governments worldwide (except for chile) are still denying us neurorights, while a synthetic hell is created as a demonic psychiatric circus, where life is gambled by inducing psychotic states and psychotic behavior in an interactive spectacle of "bursting the psychosis bubble" with, in necropolitics games which inspire so much confusion, hatred and anger amongst the population, and which are one of the reasons that led to the current war in the ukraine.


<p align="center" width="100%"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strikles/atac-data/main/messages/assets/img/jesus/adam_tree_of_life.png"></p>

<p align="center" width="100%"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strikles/atac-data/main/messages/assets/img/politicians/politicians.gif"></p>


until neurorights legislation is approved, it is likely to continue seeing more and more homeless people talking alone on the streets, scenes of domestic violence, violence against the elderly and medical personnel in your televisions with several families being destroyed in sadistic rituals of control over the physiology of others, via abuse of biophotonics, photoacoustic and thermoacoustic effects to exact remote extrajudicial sentences.


<p align="center" width="100%"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strikles/atac-data/main/messages/assets/img/us.png"></p>


* say yes to neuro rights
* say no to the initiative "homo sovieticus" to pair cybertorure with blue whale suicide games covered with psychiatric fraud
